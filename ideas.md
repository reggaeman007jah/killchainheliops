pick up troops in bush MP and RTB

when order is created, you should know how many slick pilots are available, and what their cargo capacity is  
make sure no other active missions are in-play

Determine how many units to be allocated to each heli

Determine location, and LZ - then announce the mission

CP to give directions to pilot if present, alt another player can direct - nice to have

on way, radio message to all raptors in-flight, telling them how many units will be boarding their craft

on take off, it should be known if all helis have their cargo - if not, put troops into data storage for secondary mission

// two ways to open up tasking:
when getInMan, CP will ask 'are we on station', with a time limit to answer? If confirm 'yes' within 10 seconds, then rapX confirms that rap as on-station
But we should have another keyBind to inform CP to inform KC that that rap is on station

and equally, negative when getInMan will respond to KC with - nope we are not available RN
and a keybind to say "we need to stand down".

The Yes/No keybind could potentially serve multiple purposes - ie you could have several questions that require yes or no, any one question asked could react
differently when Y/N is given .. e.g. "sir we are running low on fuel, do you want me to stand us down?" if yes, CP would issue comms to KC saying we are off station for
refuel, to which "copy that, let us know when you're back in the game". Needs fuel use accelerator to make this worthwhile, and also needs 10% increments of fuel readouts from CP
and dont forget the system to prevent CP overlaps - very important!!

// so build a function to open up reoccuring missions which will run until pilor player cancels, this will then prevent the auto-run as it stands currently
// then build a function to stand down reoccuring missions

// later we can build the yesno system
