pick up troops in bush MP and RTB

when order is created, you should know how many slick pilots are available, and what their cargo capacity is  
make sure no other active missions are in-play

Determine how many units to be allocated to each heli

Determine location, and LZ - then announce the mission

CP to give directions to pilot if present, alt another player can direct - nice to have

on way, radio message to all raptors in-flight, telling them how many units will be boarding their craft

on take off, it should be known if all helis have their cargo - if not, put troops into data storage for secondary mission
