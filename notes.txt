I can confirm Raptor 4 is ready for tasking, over 

Copy that Raptor X - break 

... a wait 

player confirms being on station via keybind (ie spoken phrase)

Player says 'This is Raptor (x) ready for tasking 
We need 5 versions of this, to match the fact they could be in any of the raptors 
The keybind sends the raptor number, so 

---

note, this has to be simple, so a player needs a simple phrase to kick off the mission .. the more complex interactions can be 
done, but only really with CP and KC .. We can explore more complex interactions when we have the basics working
